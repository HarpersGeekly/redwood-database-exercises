-- Create a new SQL script called limit_exercises.sql.
-- List the first 10 distinct last name sorted in descending order. Your result should look like this:
-- Zykh
-- Zyda
-- Zwicker
-- Zweizig
-- Zumaque
-- Zultner
-- Zucker
-- Zuberek
-- Zschoche
-- Zongker
SELECT DISTINCT last_name from employees ORDER BY last_name desc limit 10;
-- with reference:
SELECT DISTINCT e.last_name from employees e ORDER BY last_name desc limit 10;

-- Find your query for employees born on Christmas and hired in the 90s from order_by_exercises.sql. Update it to find just the first 5 employees. Their names should be:
-- Khun Bernini
-- Pohua Sudkamp
-- Xiaopeng Uehara
-- Irene Isaak
-- Dulce Wrigley

SELECT * from employees where hire_date like '199%' AND birth_date like '%-12-25' ORDER BY birth_date asc, hire_date desc LIMIT 5;

-- Try to think of your results as batches, or sets.
-- The first five results are your first batch. The five after that would be your second batch, etc.
-- Update the query to find the tenth batch of results. The employee names should be:

-- Piyawadee Bultermann
-- Heng Luft
-- Yuqun Kandlur
-- Basil Senzako
-- Mabo Zobel
